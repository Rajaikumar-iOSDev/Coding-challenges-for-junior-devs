# Coding-challenges-for-junior-devs
I’ve compiled some questions I faced and some of the questions I asked. The choice of programming language for this series would be C++. The reason I didn’t use swift as usual was most interviewers like to see us use raw techniques rather than using in-build functions. And who doesn’t love C++, it’s a legend.

# Challenges present:
1. Factorial
